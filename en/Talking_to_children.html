                <h1>Talking to children</h1>
                <p>A parent being diagnosed with ALS is difficult for the entire family. It is important that
you are open and honest about the ALS diagnosis to your children as early as possible.
Use age appropriate words and explanations when talking about the realities of ALS
and be open to answering questions at any time. Children are usually willing caregivers
to a parent with ALS and, as the disease progresses, the new and special relationship
between parent and child built through caregiving will be of great importance to both
parties.</p>
<p>The ALS Association published this detailed guide to talking to children about ALS:

<p>I wrote a blog post about telling my son I had ALS that many people find helpful:

<p>Hope Loves Company is a wonderful organization started by
Jodi O-Donnell-Ames for children of parents affected by ALS. HLC
offers books, care packages, camps, support, and so much more!
