## What is ALS?

ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a progressive, neuromuscular disease that attacks and kills motor neurons. When motor neurons die, the body loses control of its muscles, causing paralysis and weakening/atrophy of the muscles over time. Currently, an estimated 30,000 people are living with ALS in the United States. ALS is relatively rare, occurring at an incidence of 1 in 50,000 people. Men are 1.5x more likely to get ALS than women. 

## Early Symptoms

Early symptoms commonly include weakening of the muscles and muscle fasciculations (twitching). There are no defining symptoms of ALS, and a diagnosis is made by a neurologist after ruling out other possibilities.

## Outlook

Unfortunately, there are no cures for the disease. Average life expectancy after diagnosis is 2-5 years, but there are available drugs that can slow the onset of ALS. These treatments (FDA-approved) include _Radicava_ and _Riluzole_. Ask your neurologist for further details.

## Causes of ALS

An ALS diagnosis is classified as either a "familial" or a "sporadic" case. Familial account for roughly 10% of diagnoses, while sporadic represent the other 90%. 

*  A familial case is passed down through the family. Certain genetic mutations, most commonly the _SOD1_ and _C9ORF72_ mutations, are direct causes of familial ALS. 

* On the other hand, a sporadic case is ALS occurring without family history of the disease. Sporadic cases are less understood than familial ones: researchers believe causes of sporadic ALS can result from a combination of environmental triggers and genetic predispositions to the disease. However, there have been no discovered genes, like _SOD1_ or _C9ORF72_, that are directly causing onset. 

## Finding support

Finding support from other people along this journey is important. [Financial support](https://alswiki.github.io/wiki/en/Financial_Aid_Grants.html), emotional support, family support, community support, and all different kinds of help are available along the way. 

[ALS Facebook groups](https://alswiki.github.io/wiki/en/Facebook_support_groups.html) are a great place to start. With thousands of other patients connected through Facebook, support groups often provide a way to comfort each other, ask questions, and help each other through this journey.
