## What is ALS?

ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a progressive, neuromuscular disease that attacks and kills motor neurons. When motor neurons die, the body loses control of its muscles, causing paralysis and weakening/atrophy of the muscles over time. Currently, an estimated 30,000 people are living with ALS in the United States. ALS is relatively rare, occurring at an incidence of 1 in 50,000 people. Men are 1.5x more likely to get ALS than women.

## Causes of ALS

An ALS diagnosis is classified as either a "familial" or a "sporadic" case. A familial case is passed down through the family. Certain genetic mutations, most commonly the _SOD1_ and _C9ORF72_ mutations, are direct causes of familial ALS.
