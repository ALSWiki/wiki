            <p>ALS requires special attention regarding O2/Oxygen Therapy. O2 should NEVER be
given to PALS via a nasal canula. O2 should only be given to PALS bled through a
ventilator (BiPAP, Trilogy, Astral, etc). PALS and CALS need to become familiar with
the potential problems associated with O2 therapy in ALS as most doctors and nurses
are completely uninformed about the danger it poses. PALS and CALS must be
prepared to advocate for and insist on the appropriate administration of O2, especially
in emergency and hospital settings.</p>
<p>In ALS, the weakened diaphragm leads to ineffective air exchange, which will indeed
lower O2 levels in the blood, but it will also increase CO2 levels in the blood. PALS in
respiratory distress simply cannot move air adequately to prevent either situation.
Putting a PALS on O2 via nasal cannula to increase O2 in the blood tricks the body into
behaving as though it is fine, when in reality, CO2 retention can easily and quickly
occur, leading to death.</p>
<p>While O2 can be monitored easily via a PulseOx monitor, the only way to test CO2 level
is through an arterial blood gas, a (usually painful) blood test, and then waiting for the
results. It is not something that can be monitored constantly or easily. All CALS should
know and monitor their PALS for the signs of CO2 retention: Fatigue, Inability to
concentrate or think clearly, Headaches, Flushing, Dizziness, Dyspnea (shortness of
breath), Tachypnea (rapid breathing), Increased blood pressure.</p>
<p>The only time that O2 therapy via nasal canula for a PALS would be indicated is during
end of life/hospice care. Comfort and relieving of air hunger by administering O2 is of
utmost importance at the end of life and the issue of CO2 retention is moot in that
situation.</p>
