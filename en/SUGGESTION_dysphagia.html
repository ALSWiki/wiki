                <p>Advice from a Speech Therapist for patients with Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing):
- Eliminate distractions and do not talk/socialize during the meal.
- Focus on chewing and swallowing carefully and purposefully.
- Sit up straight and lean forward slightly to eat and drink.
- Tuck the chin down toward the chest while food/liquid is in the mouth and while
swallowing.
- Add sauces and gravies to dry foods to make them easier to swallow.
- If liquids roll back and down the throat in an uncontrolled manner, use a thickener in
the liquid to make it easier to control (such as SimplyThick).
- If having a hard time getting food to go down in one swallow, take smaller bites/cut
food into smaller pieces.
- If a feeling of residual food in the throat is constant, swallow two or three times after
each bite, and/or follow each swallow with a small sip of liquid to clear the residual food.
- If something feels stuck, do a “power swallow”... make an extra effort to swallow as
forcefully and completely as possible, engaging all your muscles as much as you can.
- If you choke, cough gently and swallow again before taking a breath to avoid inhaling
the food/aspirating.
- Stay upright 30 minutes after eating to avoid potential reflux and regurgitation of food
that could result in aspiration</p>
