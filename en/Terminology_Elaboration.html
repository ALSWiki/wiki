            <p>There is a lot of confusion about the terminology of "motor neuron disease," UMN vs</p>
<p>LMN, and what defines an ALS diagnosis, so here is clarification of those terms and</p>
<p>why it matters to get them correct.</p>
<p>Two Ways to Use the Term "Motor Neuron Disease”</p>
<p>-Motor Neuron Disease - a group of progressive neurological diseases that destroy</p>
<p>motor neurons</p>
<p>AND/OR</p>
<p>-Motor Neuron Disease (MND) – a synonym for ALS used primarily in the U.K., but is</p>
<p>also used in other parts of the world</p>
<p>Obviously, this is confusing! There is no simple way to distinguish which one someone</p>
<p>is talking about, unfortunately. Everything else the person refers to or talks about will</p>
<p>have to be your clue as to which one they mean, or you can ask the person directly.</p>
<p>UMN vs. LMN</p>
<p>I commonly see Upper Motor Neurons (UMN) and Lower Motor Neurons (LMN)</p>
<p>explained this way on websites, even from reputable ALS organizations:</p>
<p>“Upper Motor Neurons are in your brain. They send messages from there to</p>
<p>your spinal cord.”</p>
<p>“Lower Motor Neurons are in your spinal cord. They transmit the messages</p>
<p>sent from your brain to your muscles.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in their attempt to simplify things, these explanations are not quite</p>
<p>correct, and I imagine this is responsible for most of the confusion.</p>
<p>Better definitions would be:</p>
<p>UMN = Upper Motor Neuron -</p>
<p>neurons in the brain that extend</p>
<p>down the corticospinal tracts on</p>
<p>each side of the spinal cord to</p>
<p>the level of the appropriate</p>
<p>spinal nerve root, where they</p>
<p>synapse (connect) with the LMN</p>
<p>(to picture this in your mind's</p>
<p>eye, imagine the brain is your</p>
<p>home and the spinal column is</p>
<p>an Interstate Highway where</p>
<p>each exit is a spinal nerve root)</p>
<p>LMN = Lower Motor Neuron -</p>
<p>neurons that start at the spinal</p>
<p>nerve root and extend to the</p>
<p>muscle (imagine this as a street</p>
<p>that runs between the Interstate</p>
<p>Highway exit and your</p>
<p>destination)</p>
<p>Example: When you want to</p>
<p>move your left arm, your brain</p>
<p>sends an electrical signal that</p>
<p>travels from the brain down the</p>
<p>UMN then the LMN to your</p>
<p>muscle to make it move (It takes many muscles to move your arm, but to keep this</p>
<p>analogy simple, let's just consider one of those muscles). To picture this in your mind’s</p>
<p>eye, imagine the process of driving to the store... you get in your car (electrical signal),</p>
<p>leave your house (the brain), travel down the Interstate Highway and take the correct</p>
<p>exit (UMN), then travel down the street (LMN) until you reach the store (muscle).</p>
<p>A common misconception that I see is this:</p>
<p>UMN = nerves in arms</p>
<p>LMN = nerves in legs</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT HOW UPPER AND LOWER MOTOR NEURONS WORK!</p>
<p>Both arms and legs have UMN/LMN pathways.</p>
<p>Motor Neuron Diseases (the group, not the one disease)</p>
<p>Now that we have established the difference between UMN and LMN, let's look at a list</p>
<p>of motor neuron diseases and what kind of motor neurons are involved in each disease:</p>
<p>-ALS = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - a motor neuron disease defined by</p>
<p>both UMN and LMN involvement</p>
<p>-PLS = Primary Lateral Sclerosis - a motor neuron disease defined by</p>
<p>only UMN involvement</p>
<p>-PMA = Progressive Muscular Atrophy - a motor neuron disease defined by</p>
<p>only LMN involvement</p>
<p>-PBP = Progressive Bulbar Palsy - a motor neuron disease defined by</p>
<p>UMN and LMN involvement of the Bulbar area only</p>
<p>-SBMA (Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy) Kennedy('s) Disease –</p>
<p>a genetic LMN disease that affects males only, though females can be carriers</p>
<p>-SMA = Spinal Muscular Atrophy - a group of genetic LMN diseases classified as:</p>
<p>Type 0 (severe infantile) - present at birth</p>
<p>Type 1 (infantile) Werdnig-Hoffman Disease - ages 0-6 months</p>
<p>Type 2 (intermediate) Dubowitz-Disease - ages 6-18 months</p>
<p>Type 3 (Juvenile) Kugelberg-Welander Disease - ages 1-17+</p>
<p>Type 4 (Adult onset) - ages 30+</p>
<p>Each type has a specific set of characteristics that affect motor neuron development.</p>
<p>There are some other motor neuron diseases (you can use Google to read about them</p>
<p>all), but this is enough to illustrate the idea that different diseases are defined by the</p>
<p>presence or absence of UMN and LMN involvement.</p>
<p>Why Using the Correct Terminology is Important</p>
<p>I am often asked if it really matters what term one uses to talk about their disease. My</p>
<p>answer is always YES, it DOES matter! The main reason is because the progression</p>
<p>rate and prognosis of each motor neuron disease is very different.</p>
<p>Consider the differences in progression and prognosis between ALS, PLS, and PMA:</p>
<ul>
<li>ALS typically progresses quickly and patients die within 2-5 years of diagnosis</li>
</ul>
<p>from respiratory distress (assuming no medical interventions).</p>
<ul>
<li>PLS and PMA take many years to slowly develop and be diagnosed and patients</li>
</ul>
<p>usually live a normal or almost normal lifespan.</p>
<p>When patients fail to identify or misidentify their actual diagnosed disease when talking</p>
<p>about their experiences and treatments, especially when their progression has stopped</p>
<p>or their symptoms are improving, it often leads to misinformation and false hope for</p>
<p>others with a more serious disease. Unfortunately, there are several notable folks in our</p>
<p>community/groups who do NOT have ALS as they claim, but instead have PLS, PMA,</p>
<p>SBMA, or SMA (per their own statements regarding their diagnosed UMN/LMN</p>
<p>involvement). And their prominent sharing and promoting of how various treatments</p>
<p>have helped them retain function or get better and live longer than 5 years provokes</p>
<p>inaccurate expectations and inappropriate actions in those who do have ALS. It is</p>
<p>beneficial for you and everyone in the community to know your actual diagnosis and the</p>
<p>specifics of your own UMN and LMN involvement and to communicate those specifics</p>
<p>to others as you share experiences and information.</p>
<p>“UMN Dominant” and “LMN Dominant” ALS</p>
<p>Another common misconception that can also lead to confusion comes from</p>
<p>neurologists adding the words “UMN Dominant” or “LMN Dominant” to ALS. Neither of</p>
<p>those terms excludes the existence of UMN or LMN involvement in an ALS patient.</p>
<p>These terms should be taken literally to mean that one type of motor neuron</p>
<p>involvement is dominant over the other in that ALS patient.</p>
<p>To put it in more direct words:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you say you have "Upper Motor Neuron Dominant ALS" that does not mean you</li>
</ul>
<p>have an ALS that only involves UMNs... that actually means that you have PRIMARILY</p>
<p>UMN involvement and you do still have both UMN AND LMN involvement by the very</p>
<p>definition and diagnostic criteria of ALS.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you say you have "Lower Motor Neuron Dominant ALS" that does not mean you</li>
</ul>
<p>have an ALS that only involves LMNs.... that actually means that you have PRIMARILY</p>
<p>LMN involvement, but you still have both UMN AND LMN involvement by the very</p>
<p>definition and diagnostic criteria of ALS.</p>
<p>If you say “I have motor neuron disease,” it could be any of the above diseases with</p>
<p>varying combinations of UMN and LMN involvement. It is perfectly correct for people</p>
<p>with ALS, PLS, PMA, PBP, SBMA, and SMA to say “I have motor neuron disease.”</p>
<p>If you say “I have ALS,” then you MUST have both UMN and LMN involvement... it is</p>
<p>the very definition of ALS. And by that definition, it is INCORRECT for people with PLS,</p>
<p>PMA, PBP, SBMA, and SMA to say “I have ALS.”</p>
<p>On a related note, some people claim to have “UMN only ALS” or “LMN only ALS.”</p>
<p>Neither of those terms exist. To have only UMN or only LMN involvement is to have a</p>
<p>different motor neuron disease. [see list and explanations under “Motor Neuron</p>
<p>Diseases (the group, not the one disease)]</p>
<p>To put it in more direct words:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have ONLY LMN involvement and NO UMN involvement, you do not have ALS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have ONLY UMN involvement and NO LMN involvement, you do not have ALS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
