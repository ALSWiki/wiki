            <p>To obtain Medicare coverage for these, you will need a prescription from your doctor
supporting medical necessity for a specialty formula (HCPCS B4149). The prescription
will then go to an enteral formula provider for your zip code area to distribute your
supply. Liquid Hope, Real Food Blends and a couple others fall in this category of
specialty formula.
The PALSâ€™ medical records will need to contain documentation to support medical
necessity. Some of the reasons may be one or more of the following:
- Constipation issues (potential to lead to sepsis/septic shock)
- vomiting
- nausea
- bloating
- cramping
- diarrhea
- fatigue
- decline in mental alertness
- depression
- weight loss due to loss of appetite from varying side effects including a sense
of fullness</p>
