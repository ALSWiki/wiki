<p>ELA = esclerosis lateral amiotrófica (ALS in Spanish)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MND = Motor Neuron Disease - another name for ALS; term used in the UK and other parts of the world (see “Clarification of ALS/MND Terminology”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PALS/pALS = person/people with ALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CALS/cALS = caregiver(s) of a person with ALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VALS/vALS = veteran(s) with ALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fALS = familial ALS (NOT "familiar"), a way of saying hereditary ALS (runs in the</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>family)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CNS = central nervous system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UMN = Upper Motor Neurons - neurons originating from the motor cortex of the brain
and running through the spinal cord</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LMN = Lower Motor Neurons - neurons that connect the spinal cord to muscle fibers,
transmitting the nerve impulses from the upper motor neurons out to the muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NMJ = NeuroMuscular Junction - connections between the motor nerves and skeletal
muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCV = Nerve Conduction Study - test where electrodes are placed on the skin over a
nerve to stimulate the nerve and record the result; can help detect the presence of
nerve damage or destruction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EMG = Electromyography - a test to measure the electrical activity of a muscle; a
needle is inserted into the muscle, which acts as a microphone to amplify the sound
made by the muscle when it is contracted or relaxed; sounds (and their visual
representation on an oscilloscope) are interpreted by a neurologist to learn about the
health of muscles and nerves; specific findings on this test are required for ALS
diagnosis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LP = Lumbar Puncture, aka "spinal tap" – a needle is inserted into the space between
two lumbar vertebrae to collect CSF for diagnostic testing; CSF pressure measurements
taken during the test are also of diagnostic value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSF = cerebrospinal fluid – surrounds the brain and spinal column; obtained during a
lumbar puncture and studied for abnormalities to diagnose various neurological
conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTD = FrontoTemporal Dementia - caused by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes
of the brain; affects critical thinking, language/speech, and behavioral regions of the
brain; has been linked with some subtypes of ALS (called ALS FTD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PBA = PseudoBulbar Affect - Uncontrollable laughing or crying due to damage to the
emotion control regions of the brain; seen in 20-50% of PALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CNS-LS = Center for Neurologic Study – Liability Scale - a short questionnaire,
designed to be completed by the patient, that provides a quantitative measure of the
perceived frequency of PBA episodes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALSFRS(R) = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (Revised) – an
instrument (questionnaire) for evaluating the functional status of patients with ALS and
monitoring functional change over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOD1 = Superoxide dismutase 1 - an enzyme that destroys superoxide, a highly
reactive form of oxygen; the SOD1 gene is responsible for over 20% of fALS cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dx = diagnosis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ventilator (aka mechanical ventilation) – a machine that breathes for a person by
moving air in and out of the lungs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NIV or NonInvasive Ventilation – use of a breathing machine/ventilator with a face
mask interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IV or Invasive Ventilation - use of a ventilator through a tracheotomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trach = tracheotomy - while actually the name of the surgical procedure of making a
hole in the throat to access the trachea, most pALS call their surgical hole a "trach" or
“trache”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stoma - actual name for the hole in the throat created during a tracheotomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trach Tube = tracheotomy tube - plastic tube inserted through a tracheotomy that
allows the person to breathe without using the nose or mouth, used to connect a
tracheotomy to a ventilator</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FVC = Forced Vital Capacity - a measure of the total volume of air that can be exhaled</p>
<p>after a deep inhalation; important information for determining lung function in ALS</p>
<p>CPAP = Continuous Positive Airway Pressure – NIV breathing machine that provides</p>
<p>single pressure breathing support to keep the airway open; should NEVER be used in</p>
<p>ALS! In PALS, CPAP use weakens the diaphragm by requiring the patient’s body to use</p>
<p>extra work/force to exhale over the continuous flow of pressurized air, and can cause</p>
<p>CO2 retention.</p>
<p>BiPAP = BiLevel Positive Airway Pressure – NIV breathing machine that provides two</p>
<p>levels of pressure to assist breathing (inspiratory and expiratory pressures)</p>
<p>AVAPS = Average Volume Assured Pressure Support - a setting on certain BiPAPs and</p>
<p>ventilators that is beneficial and preferred in ALS</p>
<p>Trilogy (made by Philips Respironics) and</p>
<p>Astral (made by ResMed) - a versatile ventilator with many settings that can be used</p>
<p>with invasive and noninvasive adapters (face mask or tracheotomy)</p>
<p>VOCSN (made by Ventec Life Systems) – 5 machines in one: multifunction ventilator,</p>
<p>cough assist, suction machine, nebulizer, and oxygen generator; especially beneficial</p>
<p>for PALS who travel outside the home frequently</p>
<p>CO2 = Carbon Dioxide</p>
<p>O2 = Oxygen</p>
<p>O2 Sat or SpO2 (Oxygen Saturation) – measurement of the amount of oxygen in a</p>
<p>patient’s blood</p>
<p>Pulse Oximeter (Pulse Ox) - noninvasive infrared light device that estimates the</p>
<p>amount of oxygen in your blood; usually placed on finger or toe</p>
<p>ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) – blood test drawn from an artery (instead of a vein) to</p>
<p>measure the amount of O2, CO2, and other gases are in the blood (only way to test</p>
<p>CO2 levels)</p>
<p>PEG = Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - a flexible feeding tube placed through</p>
<p>the abdominal wall and into the stomach to allow nutrition, fluids and/or medications to</p>
<p>be put directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth</p>
<p>Mic-Key or Button = type of PEG tube that does not leave a long tube dangling outside</p>
<p>the body</p>
<p>RT = Respiratory Therapist</p>
<p>PT = Physical Therapist</p>
<p>OT = Occupational Therapist</p>
<p>ROM = Range of Motion - the measurement of the amount of movement around a</p>
<p>specific joint or body part; also refers to gentle movements/stretches to preserve range</p>
<p>of motion in joints</p>
<p>ALSA = ALS Association (USA)</p>
<p>ALS TDI = ALS Therapy Development Institute (Boston, USA)</p>
<p>NOTE: The terms “PALS” and “CALS” are plural AND singular!!!</p>
<p>When you try to make it singular by saying “my PAL” or “my CAL,” all you are saying is</p>
<p>“my Person with Amyotrophic Lateral” or “my Caregiver of Amyotrophic Lateral”.... the</p>
<p>“S” for “Sclerosis” is essential for the acronym to make sense. So, whether you are</p>
<p>talking about one person or multiple people, the acronyms are ALWAYS “PALS” and</p>
<p>“CALS.”</p>
