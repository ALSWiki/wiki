</li>
<li>
<p>PALS/pALS = person/people with ALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CALS/cALS = caregiver(s) of a person with ALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VALS/vALS = veteran(s) with ALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fALS = familial ALS (NOT "familiar"), a way of saying hereditary ALS (runs in the family)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CNS = central nervous system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UMN = Upper Motor Neurons - neurons originating from the motor cortex of the brain
and running through the spinal cord</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LMN = Lower Motor Neurons - neurons that connect the spinal cord to muscle fibers,
transmitting the nerve impulses from the upper motor neurons out to the muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NMJ = NeuroMuscular Junction - connections between the motor nerves and skeletal
muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCV = Nerve Conduction Study - test where electrodes are placed on the skin over a
nerve to stimulate the nerve and record the result; can help detect the presence of
nerve damage or destruction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EMG = Electromyography - a test to measure the electrical activity of a muscle; a
needle is inserted into the muscle, which acts as a microphone to amplify the sound
made by the muscle when it is contracted or relaxed; sounds (and their visual
representation on an oscilloscope) are interpreted by a neurologist to learn about the
health of muscles and nerves; specific findings on this test are required for ALS
diagnosis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LP = Lumbar Puncture, aka "spinal tap" – a needle is inserted into the space between
two lumbar vertebrae to collect CSF for diagnostic testing; CSF pressure measurements
taken during the test are also of diagnostic value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSF = cerebrospinal fluid – surrounds the brain and spinal column; obtained during a
lumbar puncture and studied for abnormalities to diagnose various neurological
conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTD = FrontoTemporal Dementia - caused by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes
of the brain; affects critical thinking, language/speech, and behavioral regions of the
brain; has been linked with some subtypes of ALS (called ALS FTD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PBA = PseudoBulbar Affect - Uncontrollable laughing or crying due to damage to the
emotion control regions of the brain; seen in 20-50% of PALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CNS-LS = Center for Neurologic Study – Liability Scale - a short questionnaire,
designed to be completed by the patient, that provides a quantitative measure of the
perceived frequency of PBA episodes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALSFRS(R) = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (Revised) – an
instrument (questionnaire) for evaluating the functional status of patients with ALS and
monitoring functional change over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOD1 = Superoxide dismutase 1 - an enzyme that destroys superoxide, a highly
reactive form of oxygen; the SOD1 gene is responsible for over 20% of fALS cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dx = diagnosis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ventilator (aka mechanical ventilation) – a machine that breathes for a person by
moving air in and out of the lungs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NIV or NonInvasive Ventilation – use of a breathing machine/ventilator with a face
mask interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IV or Invasive Ventilation - use of a ventilator through a tracheotomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trach = tracheotomy - while actually the name of the surgical procedure of making a
hole in the throat to access the trachea, most pALS call their surgical hole a "trach" or
“trache”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stoma - actual name for the hole in the throat created during a tracheotomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trach Tube = tracheotomy tube - plastic tube inserted through a tracheotomy that
allows the person to breathe without using the nose or mouth, used to connect a
tracheotomy to a ventilator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FVC = Forced Vital Capacity - a measure of the total volume of air that can be exhaled
after a deep inhalation; important information for determining lung function in ALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPAP = Continuous Positive Airway Pressure – NIV breathing machine that provides
single pressure breathing support to keep the airway open; should NEVER be used in
ALS! In PALS, CPAP use weakens the diaphragm by requiring the patient’s body to use
extra work/force to exhale over the continuous flow of pressurized air, and can cause
CO2 retention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BiPAP = BiLevel Positive Airway Pressure – NIV breathing machine that provides two
levels of pressure to assist breathing (inspiratory and expiratory pressures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AVAPS = Average Volume Assured Pressure Support - a setting on certain BiPAPs and
ventilators that is beneficial and preferred in ALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trilogy (made by Philips Respironics) and
Astral (made by ResMed) - a versatile ventilator with many settings that can be used
with invasive and noninvasive adapters (face mask or tracheotomy)
VOCSN (made by Ventec Life Systems) – 5 machines in one: multifunction ventilator,
cough assist, suction machine, nebulizer, and oxygen generator; especially beneficial
for PALS who travel outside the home frequently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CO2 = Carbon Dioxide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O2 = Oxygen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O2 Sat or SpO2 (Oxygen Saturation) – measurement of the amount of oxygen in a
patient’s blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pulse Oximeter (Pulse Ox) - noninvasive infrared light device that estimates the
amount of oxygen in your blood; usually placed on finger or toe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) – blood test drawn from an artery (instead of a vein) to
measure the amount of O2, CO2, and other gases are in the blood (only way to test
CO2 levels)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEG = Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - a flexible feeding tube placed through
the abdominal wall and into the stomach to allow nutrition, fluids and/or medications to
be put directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth
Mic-Key or Button = type of PEG tube that does not leave a long tube dangling outside
the body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RT = Respiratory Therapist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PT = Physical Therapist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OT = Occupational Therapist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ROM = Range of Motion - the measurement of the amount of movement around a
specific joint or body part; also refers to gentle movements/stretches to preserve range
of motion in joints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALSA = ALS Association (USA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALS TDI = ALS Therapy Development Institute (Boston, USA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOTE: The terms “PALS” and “CALS” are plural AND singular!!!
When you try to make it singular by saying “my PAL” or “my CAL,” all you are saying is
“my Person with Amyotrophic Lateral” or “my Caregiver of Amyotrophic Lateral”.... the
“S” for “Sclerosis” is essential for the acronym to make sense. So, whether you are
talking about one person or multiple people, the acronyms are ALWAYS “PALS” and
“CALS.”</p>
