There is a lot of confusion about the terminology of "motor neuron disease," UMN vs LMN, and what defines an ALS diagnosis, so here is clarification of those terms and why it matters to get them correct.

Two Ways to Use the Term "Motor Neuron Disease”

-Motor Neuron Disease - a group of progressive neurological diseases that destroymotor neurons

AND/OR

-Motor Neuron Disease (MND) – a synonym for ALS used primarily in the U.K., but is also used in other parts of the world

Obviously, this is confusing! There is no simple way to distinguish which one someone is talking about, unfortunately. Everything else the person refers to or talks about will have to be your clue as to which one they mean, or you can ask the person directly.


UMN vs. LMN

I commonly see Upper Motor Neurons (UMN) and Lower Motor Neurons (LMN)

explained this way on websites, even from reputable ALS organizations:

“Upper Motor Neurons are in your brain. They send messages from there to

your spinal cord.”

“Lower Motor Neurons are in your spinal cord. They transmit the messages

sent from your brain to your muscles.”

Unfortunately, in their attempt to simplify things, these explanations are not quite

correct, and I imagine this is responsible for most of the confusion.

Better definitions would be:

UMN = Upper Motor Neuron -

neurons in the brain that extend

down the corticospinal tracts on

each side of the spinal cord to

the level of the appropriate

spinal nerve root, where they

synapse (connect) with the LMN

(to picture this in your mind's

eye, imagine the brain is your

home and the spinal column is

an Interstate Highway where

each exit is a spinal nerve root)

LMN = Lower Motor Neuron -

neurons that start at the spinal

nerve root and extend to the

muscle (imagine this as a street

that runs between the Interstate

Highway exit and your

destination)

Example: When you want to

move your left arm, your brain

sends an electrical signal that

travels from the brain down the

UMN then the LMN to your

muscle to make it move (It takes many muscles to move your arm, but to keep this

analogy simple, let's just consider one of those muscles). To picture this in your mind’s

eye, imagine the process of driving to the store... you get in your car (electrical signal),

leave your house (the brain), travel down the Interstate Highway and take the correct

exit (UMN), then travel down the street (LMN) until you reach the store (muscle).



A common misconception that I see is this:

UMN = nerves in arms

LMN = nerves in legs

THIS IS NOT HOW UPPER AND LOWER MOTOR NEURONS WORK!

Both arms and legs have UMN/LMN pathways.

Motor Neuron Diseases (the group, not the one disease)

Now that we have established the difference between UMN and LMN, let's look at a list

of motor neuron diseases and what kind of motor neurons are involved in each disease:

-ALS = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - a motor neuron disease defined by

both UMN and LMN involvement

-PLS = Primary Lateral Sclerosis - a motor neuron disease defined by



only UMN involvement



-PMA = Progressive Muscular Atrophy - a motor neuron disease defined by



only LMN involvement

-PBP = Progressive Bulbar Palsy - a motor neuron disease defined by



UMN and LMN involvement of the Bulbar area only



-SBMA (Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy) Kennedy('s) Disease –

a genetic LMN disease that affects males only, though females can be carriers

-SMA = Spinal Muscular Atrophy - a group of genetic LMN diseases classified as:

Type 0 (severe infantile) - present at birth

Type 1 (infantile) Werdnig-Hoffman Disease - ages 0-6 months

Type 2 (intermediate) Dubowitz-Disease - ages 6-18 months

Type 3 (Juvenile) Kugelberg-Welander Disease - ages 1-17+

Type 4 (Adult onset) - ages 30+

Each type has a specific set of characteristics that affect motor neuron development.

There are some other motor neuron diseases (you can use Google to read about them

all), but this is enough to illustrate the idea that different diseases are defined by the

presence or absence of UMN and LMN involvement.



Why Using the Correct Terminology is Important

I am often asked if it really matters what term one uses to talk about their disease. My

answer is always YES, it DOES matter! The main reason is because the progression

rate and prognosis of each motor neuron disease is very different.



Consider the differences in progression and prognosis between ALS, PLS, and PMA:

- ALS typically progresses quickly and patients die within 2-5 years of diagnosis

from respiratory distress (assuming no medical interventions).

- PLS and PMA take many years to slowly develop and be diagnosed and patients

usually live a normal or almost normal lifespan.

When patients fail to identify or misidentify their actual diagnosed disease when talking

about their experiences and treatments, especially when their progression has stopped

or their symptoms are improving, it often leads to misinformation and false hope for

others with a more serious disease. Unfortunately, there are several notable folks in our

community/groups who do NOT have ALS as they claim, but instead have PLS, PMA,

SBMA, or SMA (per their own statements regarding their diagnosed UMN/LMN

involvement). And their prominent sharing and promoting of how various treatments

have helped them retain function or get better and live longer than 5 years provokes

inaccurate expectations and inappropriate actions in those who do have ALS. It is

beneficial for you and everyone in the community to know your actual diagnosis and the

specifics of your own UMN and LMN involvement and to communicate those specifics

to others as you share experiences and information.



“UMN Dominant” and “LMN Dominant” ALS

Another common misconception that can also lead to confusion comes from

neurologists adding the words “UMN Dominant” or “LMN Dominant” to ALS. Neither of

those terms excludes the existence of UMN or LMN involvement in an ALS patient.

These terms should be taken literally to mean that one type of motor neuron

involvement is dominant over the other in that ALS patient.

To put it in more direct words:

- When you say you have "Upper Motor Neuron Dominant ALS" that does not mean you

have an ALS that only involves UMNs... that actually means that you have PRIMARILY

UMN involvement and you do still have both UMN AND LMN involvement by the very

definition and diagnostic criteria of ALS.

- When you say you have "Lower Motor Neuron Dominant ALS" that does not mean you

have an ALS that only involves LMNs.... that actually means that you have PRIMARILY

LMN involvement, but you still have both UMN AND LMN involvement by the very

definition and diagnostic criteria of ALS.

If you say “I have motor neuron disease,” it could be any of the above diseases with

varying combinations of UMN and LMN involvement. It is perfectly correct for people

with ALS, PLS, PMA, PBP, SBMA, and SMA to say “I have motor neuron disease.”

If you say “I have ALS,” then you MUST have both UMN and LMN involvement... it is

the very definition of ALS. And by that definition, it is INCORRECT for people with PLS,

PMA, PBP, SBMA, and SMA to say “I have ALS.”





On a related note, some people claim to have “UMN only ALS” or “LMN only ALS.”

Neither of those terms exist. To have only UMN or only LMN involvement is to have a

different motor neuron disease. [see list and explanations under “Motor Neuron

Diseases (the group, not the one disease)]

To put it in more direct words:

- If you have ONLY LMN involvement and NO UMN involvement, you do not have ALS.

- If you have ONLY UMN involvement and NO LMN involvement, you do not have ALS.
