                <p>Acquisition of equipment BEFORE it is needed is ideal in ALS. It can take days, weeks,
or months to obtain a prescription from the doctor, order the equipment, and wait for
delivery. While it may be difficult to think ahead and face upcoming changes and
challenges, you will be glad to already have the equipment on hand when you need it.
Some of the medical devices/equipment you will need are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Walkers/Rollators – insurance will cover a rollator
(rolling walker with a seat), or you can pay out-of-pocket.
Both canes and walkers are often available for free through
the ALS Association or MDA Loaner Closet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shower bench, grab bars, and hand-held shower head
will all make showering easier in the early stages. As ALS
progresses to total paralysis, patients require
showering/bathing performed by a caregiver either in a roll-
in shower with a rolling shower chair or sponge
bathing/other adaptive bathing techniques performed with
the patient in bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hospital bed – prescribed by doctor and bought/rented/delivered from a home health
company. The head and foot of the hospital bed can be raised and lowered for
positioning and comfort, and the entire bed can be raised to assist caregivers in
attending the patient (major benefit for the caregiver’s lower back). An alternating
pressure pad is usually also prescribed with the bed to prevent bed sores. Standard
adjustable beds can be an option if you do not want a hospital bed, but they do not have
a feature to raise the entire bed. Beds larger than a Twin/TwinXL can make it difficult for
the caregiver to access the patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hoyer Lift - a small rolling crane from
which a patient sling is suspended via loops.
When seated in the sling, the patient can be
raised, lowered, and moved from one location
to another (such as bed to wheelchair or
wheelchair to toilet). Hoyer lifts can be manual,
requiring the caregiver to manipulate the sling
up and down by turning cranks or pumping a
handle, or electric, powered by a rechargeable
battery and operated by a remote control. If
there is not enough space to maneuver a
Hoyer lift, a ceiling track can be installed
between two or more rooms/locations on the
same floor to move the sling and patient.
There are other types of lifts available to suit a
variety of needs, but the Hoyer lift is the most
common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom power wheelchair – this
will not be a basic power wheelchair
like a Hoveround or Jazzy that many
elderly people use. This power
wheelchair will be completely custom-
made for your body and have special
features: legs that elevate; the seat
will tilt and recline; and there will be all
kinds of special parts, armrests,
headrests, and controls that can be
changed over time to suit your needs
as ALS progresses. A seat elevator is
preferred, but usually not covered by
insurance or Medicare. Team Gleason
will pay for the seat elevator, but you
must apply to them BEFORE the wheelchair is ordered. Permobil and Quantum are the
most common power wheelchair brands used by PALS. A Roho air cushion or Jay gel
cushion are recommended in place of the standard wheelchair seat for comfort and for
preventing pressure sores. The doctor will write a prescription for the power wheelchair
(usually detailing specific features required so that insurance will cover them) and you
will then have a consultation with a DME representative who will measure you and help
you select certain options. It can take 3-4 months for the power wheelchair to be
ordered, built, and delivered, so do not wait until you need one to ask for one.
Manual (regular) wheelchair - If you need a manual wheelchair, borrow or buy one
out-of-pocket. DO NOT LET INSURANCE OR MEDICARE PAY FOR A MANUAL
WHEELCHAIR. You are allowed ONE wheelchair (be it manual or power) every 5
years. Manual wheelchairs cost ~$150. A custom power wheelchair is ~$40,000. The
ALS Association and MDA usually have manual wheelchairs available from the Loaner
Closet. If you have weak arms and cannot propel yourself by the two large wheels of a
regular wheelchair, then consider getting a “transport” wheelchair that has four small
wheels instead. It is much easier for your caregiver to push/maneuver and fold up into a
car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handicap Accessible Van – not everyone can afford or wants a van, but if you plan to
travel with your custom power wheelchair, this is the only option aside from public
transport. (A custom power wheelchair should NEVER be carried on a mount or trailer
outside of a vehicle!) The best way to find a handicap accessible van is to go to a
dealership where there will be new and used vans of different models and conversions
and different price points available. It is important that you “try on” the van to make sure
the PALS and their wheelchair can enter, turn around, and exit the van easily and that a
caregiver will have room to assist the PALS when needed. The dealership can also help
with obtaining financing that may be longer term than a standard car loan to help keep
the payments affordable. Digital Federal Credit Union offers 10-year financing on new
and used vans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CoughAssist from Respironics – a machine that forces air in
and out of the lungs to simulate a cough to help remove mucus
and secretions that build up in the lungs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suction Machine – device for removing mucus, secretions, and
other fluids from the mouth, nose, and/or respiratory track</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SmartVest from Electromed or other
brand of Percussion Vest – a vest attached to
a machine by hoses that oscillates air at
varying frequencies to “shake” the patient,
loosening mucus and secretions that build up
in the lungs, making them easier to expel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BiPAP = BiLevel Positive Airway Pressure –
NIV breathing machine that provides two levels
of pressure to assist breathing (inspiratory and
expiratory pressures) via a face mask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trilogy (made by Philips Respironics)
and Astral (made by ResMed) – two
models/brands of versatile ventilators with
many operational modes and settings
(CPAP, BiPAP, etc) that can be used as
noninvasive (face mask) or invasive
(tracheotomy) ventilation. Both options have
internal rechargeable batteries, making them
a more portable option than a regular BiPAP
for noninvasive users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VOCSN (made by Ventec Life Systems) – 5 machines in one: multifunction ventilator,
cough assist, suction machine, nebulizer, and oxygen generator; especially beneficial
for PALS who travel outside the home frequently</p>
