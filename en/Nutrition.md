When starting PEG feeding, most PALS are prescribed one of several basic “adult” or
“enteral” formulas. While they do provide complete nutrition, many of the common
formulas do not “agree” with the PALS and cause a variety of digestive issues. There
are other healthier options available, such as Liquid Hope, Whole Food Blends, Kate
Farms, etc. that should not cause digestive problems.
